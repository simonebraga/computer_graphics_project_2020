# Computer Graphics (A.A. 2019-2020)

The development of this project is part of the computer graphics course at Politecnico di Milano. The exam is composed of a set of assignments and a project, aimed to prove the knowledge of the topics of the course.

### Assignments

I am not sharing the solution to the assignments since they could be reassigned to the students of the course.

### Project

_"Design a 3D anatomy visualizer. It must be possible to move, zoom, and rotate the model of the body. There must be a GUI in which to choose specific parts of the body so that, when selected, the model will spin to make them face the camera. Pop-up cards with information on the selected part must appear (GUI)."_

The given specification must be fulfilled using HTML5 & WebGL to develop a static website.
